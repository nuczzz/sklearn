# sklearn
Machine learning example based on scikit-learn.

# scikit-learn install
```
pip install sklearn
```
If terminal shows error like this:
```
Collecting numpy>=1.8.2 (from scikit-learn->sklearn)
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement numpy>=1.8.2 (from scikit-learn->sklearn) (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for numpy>=1.8.2 (from scikit-learn->sklearn)
```
You can install 'numpy' (maybe numpy+mkl) with command:
```
pip install numpy
```
Maybe package 'scipy' should be install if it is not exists.
```
pip install scipy
```
